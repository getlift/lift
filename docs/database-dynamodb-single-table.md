# Database - DynamoDB Single Table

The `database/dynamodb-single-table` construct deploys a single DynamoDB table with pre-configured indexes following [Single Table Design](https://www.alexdebrie.com/posts/dynamodb-single-table/) principles.

## Quick start

```bash
serverless plugin install -n serverless-lift
```

```yaml
service: my-app
provider:
  name: aws

constructs:
    myTable:
        type: database/dynamodb-single-table

plugins:
    - serverless-lift
```

On `serverless deploy`, a preconfigured DynamoDB table will be created.

## How it works

The `database/dynamodb-single-table` construct creates and configures the table for production following [Single Table Design](https://www.alexdebrie.com/posts/dynamodb-single-table/) principles:

- a composite primary index with generic attributes names - `PK` for the partition key and `SK` for the sort key
- a configurable amount of up to 20 glocal secondary indexes with generic names - `GSI-1` to `GSI-20` for the index names, `GSI-1-PK` to `GSI-20-PK` for the partition keys and `GSI-1-SK` to `GSI-20-SK` for the sort keys
- all indexes attributes have string data type, ideal for composite attribue - i.e. `value1#value2`
- a DynamoDB stream publishing new and old values at each write operation on the table
- a TTL attribute enabling DynamoDB automatic garbage collection set to `TimeToLive`
- a billing mode set to `PAY_PER_REQUEST`

## Variables

All database constructs expose the following variables:

- `tableName`: the name of the deployed DynamoDB table
- `tableArn`: the arn of the deployed DynamoDB table
- `tableStreamArn`: the ARN of the stream of the deployed DynamoDB table

This can be used to inject the tableName to a Lambda functions using the SDK to read or write data from the table, for example:

```yaml
constructs:
    myTable:
        type: database/dynamodb-single-table

functions:
    myFunction:
        handler: src/index.handler
        environment:
            TABLE_NAME: ${construct:myTable.tableName}
```

_How it works: the `${construct:myTable.tableName}` variable will automatically be replaced with a CloudFormation reference to the DynamoDB table._

## Permissions

By default, all the Lambda functions deployed in the same `serverless.yml` file **will be allowed to read/write into the table**, on all indexes (primary and secondary).

In the example below, there are no IAM permissions to set up: `myFunction` will be allowed to read and write into the `myTable` table.

```yaml
constructs:
    myTable:
        type: database/dynamodb-single-table

functions:
    myFunction:
        handler: src/index.handler
        environment:
            TABLE_NAME: ${construct:myTable.tableName}
```

## Configuration reference

### Global secondary indexes

Global secondary indexes have a direct impact on the cost of a DynamoDB table. There is no GSI configured by default on the database construct.

You can specify the amount of GSI you'd like to enable on a DynamoDB table using the `gsiCount` property.

```yaml
constructs:
    myTable:
        # ...
        gsiCount: 3
```

GSI created on the table follow generic names principles:
- `GSI-1` to `GSI-20` for the index names
- `GSI-1-PK` to `GSI-20-PK` for the partition keys
- `GSI-1-SK` to `GSI-20-SK` for the sort keys

The first time you deploy your construct using `serverless deploy`, you can specify any amount of GSI between `1` and `20`. On subsequent deploys, any modification made to an already deployed construct cannot add or remove more than 1 GSI at a time. If you need 2 additional GSI after initial deployment of the exemple above, you must first update the `gsiCount` to `4`, deploy, and then finally update it to the final desired quantity of `5`.

#### Global secondary index naming and types

Global secondary indexes are created following [Global secondary indexes principles](#global-secondary-indexes) outlined above. If you need to deviate from the standard naming convention and types you can specify the settings for each GSI as follows:

```yaml
constructs:
    myTable:
        # ...
        gsiCount: 1
        gsis:
            - index: GSI-1-SK
              name: mySecondaryIndex1Sort # override the default naming
              type: number # make the sort key numeric
```

### Local secondary indexes

Each DynamoDB table can includes up to 5 local secondary indexes. You can deploy a table with those 5 indexes using the `localSecondaryIndexes` property.

> :warning: LSIs introduce a [limitation on partition size of a table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/LSI.html#LSI.ItemCollections.SizeLimit). Due to this limitation, `localSecondaryIndexes` is set to false and this construct will not provision any LSI on the table by default.

Setting `localSecondaryIndexes` to true will provision 5 LSIs with generic names - `LSI-1` to `LSI-5` for the index names and `LSI-1-SK` to `LSI-5-SK` for the sort keys. Those indexes have no impact on pricing as long as their sort keys are not populated with data.

```yaml
constructs:
    myTable:
        # ...
        localSecondaryIndexes: true
```

> :warning: Modifying a table local secondary indexes configuration requires table re-creation. If you modify this setting after the table has been populated with data, you'll need to transfer all data from old table to the new one. You however won't loose any data as all tables are configured to be left as is when removed from a CloudFormation template.

## Extensions

You can specify an `extensions` property on the `database/dynamodb-single-table` construct to extend the underlying CloudFormation resources. In the exemple below, the DynamoDB Table CloudFormation resource generated by the `myTable` dynamodb-single-table construct will be extended with the new `TableClass: STANDARD_INFREQUENT_ACCESS` CloudFormation property.

```yaml
constructs:
    myTable:
        type: database/dynamodb-single-table
        extensions:
            table:
                Properties:
                    TableClass: STANDARD_INFREQUENT_ACCESS
```
