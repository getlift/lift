# Single page app

The `single-page-app` construct deploys **single-page applications**, for example React or VueJS applications

## Quick start

```bash
serverless plugin install -n serverless-lift
```

```yaml
service: my-app
provider:
    name: aws

constructs:
    landing:
        type: single-page-app
        path: public

plugins:
    - serverless-lift
```

On `serverless deploy`, the `public/` directory will be deployed as a public website.

_Note: **the first deployment takes 4 minutes**. Next deployments only take seconds._

The website is served over HTTPS and cached all over the world via the CloudFront CDN.

## How it works

On the first `serverless deploy`, Lift creates:

- an [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket
- a [CloudFront CDN](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) configured to serve the website from S3 over HTTPS, with caching at the edge
- CloudFront Functions to set security HTTP headers

Additionally, every time `serverless deploy` runs, Lift:

- uploads all files from the configured directory to the S3 bucket
- invalidates the CloudFront cache so that the new version of the website is live

_Note: the S3 bucket is entirely managed by Lift. Do not store or upload files to the bucket, they will be removed by Lift on the next deployment. Instead, create a separate bucket to store any extra file._

## React

To deploy a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app, use the following configuration:

```yaml
constructs:
    react:
        type: single-page-app
        path: build
```

To deploy, run:

```
npm run build
serverless deploy
```

## Vue

To deploy a [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) app, use the following configuration:

```yaml
constructs:
    vue:
        type: single-page-app
        path: dist
```

To deploy, run:

```
npm run build
serverless deploy
```

## Commands

`serverless deploy` deploys everything configured in `serverless.yml` and uploads website files.

It is possible to skip the CloudFormation deployment and directly publish website changes via:

```
serverless <construct-name>:upload

# For example:
serverless landing:upload
```

This command only takes seconds: it directly uploads files to S3 and clears the CloudFront cache.

## Variables

All single-page-app constructs expose the following variables:

- `cname`: the domain name of the resource, such as `d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`

This can be used to reference the bucket from Route53 configuration, for example:

```yaml
constructs:
    landing:
        type: single-page-app
        path: public

resources:
  Resources:
    Route53Record:
      Type: AWS::Route53::RecordSet
      Properties:
        HostedZoneId: ZXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXJ # Your HostedZoneId
        Name: app.mydomain
        Type: A
        AliasTarget:
          HostedZoneId: Z2FDTNDATAQYW2 # Cloudfront Route53 HostedZoneId. This does not change.
          DNSName: ${construct:landing.cname}
```

_How it works: the `${construct:landing.cname}` variable will automatically be replaced with a CloudFormation reference to the CloudFront Distribution._

- `assetsBucketName`: the S3 assets bucketname

This can be used to configure a S3 bucket policy for example:

```yaml
constructs:
    landing:
        type: single-page-app
        # ...
resources:
    Resources:
        BucketPolicy:
            Type: AWS::S3::BucketPolicy
            Properties:
                Bucket: ${construct:landing.assetsBucketName}
                # ...
```

## Configuration reference

### Path

```yaml
constructs:
    landing:
        type: single-page-app
        path: public
```

The `path` option should point to the local directory containing the single page application. Use `path: .` to upload the content of the current directory.

All files in that directory will be deployed and made available publicly.

When using a JavaScript bundler (for example when working with Webpack, VueJS, React, etc.), upload the compiled files. For example this could be the `dist/` directory.

### Custom domain

```yaml
constructs:
    landing:
        # ...
        domain: mywebsite.com
        # ARN of an ACM certificate for the domain, registered in us-east-1
        certificate: arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456615250:certificate/0a28e63d-d3a9-4578-9f8b-14347bfe8123
```

The configuration above will activate the custom domain `mywebsite.com` on CloudFront, using the provided HTTPS certificate.

After running `serverless deploy` (or `serverless info`), you should see the following output in the terminal:

```
landing:
  url: https://mywebsite.com
  cname: s13hocjp.cloudfront.net
```

Create a CNAME DNS entry that points your domain to the `xxx.cloudfront.net` domain. After a few minutes/hours, the domain should be available.

#### HTTPS certificate

To create the HTTPS certificate:

- Open [the ACM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-1#/wizard/) in the `us-east-1` region (CDN certificates _must be_ in us-east-1, regardless of where your application is hosted)
- Click "_Request a new certificate_", add your domain name and click "Next"
- Choose a domain validation method:
  - Domain validation will require you to add CNAME entries to your DNS configuration
  - Email validation will require you to click a link in an email sent to `admin@your-domain.com`

After the certificate is created and validated, you should see the ARN of the certificate.

#### Multiple domains

It is possible to set up multiple domains:

```yaml
constructs:
    landing:
        # ...
        domain:
            - mywebsite.com
            - app.mywebsite.com
```

#### Redirect all domains to a single one

It is sometimes necessary to redirect one or several domains to a single one. A common example is to redirect the root domain to the `www` version.

```yaml
constructs:
    website:
        # ...
        domain:
            - www.mywebsite.com
            - mywebsite.com
        redirectToMainDomain: true
```

The first domain in the list will be considered the main domain. In this case, `mywebsite.com` will redirect to `www.mywebsite.com`.

### Response headers policy

By default, the response headers policy is set to [Managed-SecurityHeadersPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-response-headers-policies.html#managed-response-headers-policies-security). To override this policy, set the `responseHeadersPolicy` to the policy ID:

```yaml
constructs:
    landing:
        # ...
        responseHeadersPolicy: 0a28e63d-d3a9-4578-9f8b-14347bfe8123 # Your Policy ID
```

or create a [response headers policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_cloudfront.ResponseHeadersPolicyProps.html) inline:

```yaml
constructs:
    landing:
        # ...
        responseHeadersPolicy:
            responseHeadersPolicyName: CustomPolicy
            securityHeadersBehavior:
                contentSecurityPolicy:
                    contentSecurityPolicy: default-src https:;
                    override: true
```

## Extensions

You can specify an `extensions` property on the `single-page-app` construct to extend the underlying CloudFormation resources. In the exemple below, the CloudFront Distribution CloudFormation resource generated by the `landing` single-page-app construct will be extended with the new `Comment: Landing distribution` CloudFormation property.

```yaml
constructs:
    landing:
        type: single-page-app
        path: public
        extensions:
            distribution:
                Properties:
                    Comment: Landing distribution
```
